# 🍽️ Food Rescue - Reducing Food Waste in India (ODD12)

## 📌 Overview
Food Rescue is an innovative platform connecting restaurants and supermarkets with charitable organizations to redistribute surplus food to those in need. If the food is spoiled, our system links these businesses with local farmers to transform waste into compost. 🌍♻️ 

Our mission aligns with **UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)**, tackling food waste in India through **technology-driven solutions**. 🚀

## 🏗️ System Design & Architecture
Our solution is built using:
- **Frontend:** Flutter 📱
- **Backend:** Supabase 🔥
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 🛢️
- **Cloud Storage:** Supabase Storage ☁️
- **AI Integration (Upcoming):** To analyze food freshness and prevent waste using ML models 🤖

The architecture follows a **scalable and modular approach**, ensuring:
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear distinction between frontend, backend, and database.
- **Secure Data Handling (Upcoming):** Authentication and authorization managed via Supabase. 
- **Real-time Data Sync:** Leveraging Supabase’s real-time capabilities.
